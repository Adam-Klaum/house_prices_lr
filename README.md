# Predicting House Prices Based on Features Using Linear Regression

The goal of this project is to utilize the Linear Regression algorithm to see if we can predict house prices using data about house features vs. known house prices.  


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

```
python 3.x
```

### Installing

In your location of choice run:

```
git clone https://github.com/Adam-Klaum/house_prices_lr.git  
```

Enter the house_prices_lr directory.

If you are running conda, use the following command to create a virtual environment with the correct dependencies:

```
conda env create
```

If you would rather use pip then use the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you want to do things manually, then you will need the following python packages:

```
numpy
pandas
seaborn
matplotlib
jupyter
scikit-learn
```

## Running

Start a jupyter notebook and navigate to the car_prices.ipynb file.
